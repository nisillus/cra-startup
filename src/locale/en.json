  "A_DIVIDEND_DISTRIBUTED?": "Each plan of TRX Pro lasts for 60 days after investment. Dividend generates every second and is added to your withdrawal balance automatically. Players can choose to withdraw or reinvest the dividends (as long as there is enough TRX to withdraw in the contract balance). <br/>Plan and the RIO details are as follows: <br/>Direct investment: Day 1~5 1.8%, Day 6~10 2.4%, Day 11~20 3%, Day 21~30 3.6%, Day 31~45 4.2%, Day 46~60 4.8%. Reinvestment: Day 1~10 3%, Day 11~20 3.6%, Day 21~30 4.2%, Day 31~60 4.8%. Note: As soon as the dividend is withdrawn or reinvest, the ROI will be reset to initial state (Day 1) and increase from the very start. It would be better not to withdraw frequently because in that case, the ROI may stay at a low level. Reinvestment can increase the amount of investment, and the first 10 days of reinvestment can get more income.",
